1) As a hungry client, I want to be able to easily order food for pick-up from my favourite restaurant's
    website, so that I can save time and avoid the hassle of waiting in line.


2) When I visit the restaurant's website, I am presented with a list of menu items and their prices. I can
     select one or more dishes, and add them to my cart.

3). As a user I want to be able to view food photos of the restaurantâ€™s favourite dishes, to help me make a
    decision on what to order

4) Once I have added all the items I want to my cart, I can proceed to checkout.

5) At checkout, I am asked to provide my name, phone number, and payment information. I can choose to
     pay with a credit card or with cash at the restaurant.

6) After I submit my order, the restaurant receives an SMS notification with the details of my order,
     including my name and phone number.

7) The restaurant can then specify how long it will take to fulfill my order. Once they provide this
     information, I receive an SMS notification with the estimated wait time.

8) As a user I want to be able to view the updates on my order on the website (automated)

9)  When my order is ready, I receive another SMS notification letting me know that it's time to come pick it
      up.

10) At the restaurant, I show my order confirmation on my phone, and I am handed my food. Overall, I
    appreciate the convenience and simplicity of this food ordering system, and I am more likely to order
    from this restaurant again in the future.
